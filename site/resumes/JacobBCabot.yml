    motto: Full Stack Developer
    summary: |
     Highly driven, adaptable, coachable full stack developer who is passionate in refining my technical and developer skills with the new trends that surrounds the modern world of technology. Strong focus on React.js, CSS, WordPress, Python, NodeJS, and PHP, with particular interest in Front/Back-end Development. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me weightlifting, spending time with my 3 children and 2 dogs, or doing activities to better myself including working on additional coding projects to deepen my understanding of the concepts and topics.
